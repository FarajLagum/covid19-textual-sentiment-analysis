For the third consecutive day we are hearing about a significant #LRT delay during the morning commute on the #ConfederationLine. How many more times can these delays occur before there is some real accountability? Winter is coming. What is going on?,0,third consecutive day hearing significant delay morning commute many more time can delay occur real accountability winter come what
I think capacity in rush hour is definitely an issue. The LRT just isn’t big enough to replace all the buses that have been removed especially during peak transit months in the fall/winter. Some bus routes need to be restored. #ottLRT #lrtOttawa #octranspo,1,think capacity rush hour definitely issue lrt just not_big enough replace bus remove especially peak transit month fall winter bus route need restore
